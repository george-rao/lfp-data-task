The data analysis contained in this repository is based on a dataset on labor force participation. This dataset is not stored in the repository; it needs to be copied into the data folder before the R code can run.

To get the dataset, go to https://predoc.org/pre-workshop, scroll down to "The Data Task," and download the sample data task. Unzip the files, add "cps_women_lfp.csv" to this repository's data folder, and you should be all set.

Alternatively, you may be able to download the zip file directly here: https://predoc.org/-/media/project/chicago-booth/consortium/predoc/documents/pre_datatask2024.zip
